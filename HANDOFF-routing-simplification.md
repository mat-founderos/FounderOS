# Routing Simplification Handoff - Matthew Calabia
**Created:** 2026-04-20
**Owner:** Matthew Calabia (Webflow)
**Deadline:** 2026-04-21 09:00 ET (7 hours from handoff)
**Approver:** Don Robinson (all code changes require Don's explicit approval with a deterministic reason)

---

## What This Branch Does

The `routing-simplification` branch fixes a live bug where leads get routed to wrong Calendly events because the old script used UTMs for routing. Root cause: `application-routing-ads.js` runs on organic pages and conflates attribution with routing.

**The fix:** `application-routing-v2.js` was rewritten to use score-only routing. Two routes out (qualified/nurture), no UTM involvement in routing decisions. UTMs ride along as attribution params only. Single Brand Strategy Call event for all qualified /apply leads (cxvc-8mr-npb). No more Intro Call. No more closer/setter split.

**Branch status:** 8 commits ahead of main, 1 behind (utmScript.js - clean merge). Code review complete Apr 20.

---

## Hard Gates

1. **No code changes without Don's approval.** If something needs to change, tell Don exactly what and why before touching it.
2. **3 manual browser test cycles minimum.** Not automated. Not Claude. Matthew in a real browser on the staging pages.
3. **Every step verified before moving to next.** No skipping.
4. **No merge to main without Don's explicit approval.**
5. **Webflow audit before go-live.** Every stale page that no longer accepts traffic must be identified and cleaned.

## Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Branch Prep (15 min)

- [ ] Clone the repo (or pull latest): `git clone git@github.com:Matt-Gray-Founder-OS/FounderOS.git && cd FounderOS`
- [ ] Checkout the branch: `git checkout routing-simplification`
- [ ] Merge main into the branch to pick up utmScript.js changes: `git merge main`
- [ ] Resolve any conflicts (expect none - utmScript.js was changed on both but branch has superset)
- [ ] Verify the merge is clean: `git status`

### Phase 2: Understand What Changed (20 min)

Read these files to understand the routing logic:

| File | What Changed |
|------|-------------|
| `application-routing-v2.js` | Rewritten. Score-only routing. Two routes: qualified (score >= threshold + solo decision) or nurture. No _ads suffix. UTMs captured but not used for routing. |
| `applicationFormControlNew.js` | Form ID canonicalized from `application-form-ads` to `fos-application-main`. Dead code removed. |
| `application-form-name-handler.js` | Minor cleanup. |
| `utmScript.js` | 30-day cookies, fbclid + hsa_* param capture for HubSpot Ads attribution. |
| `PROJECT_BRIEF_ROUTING_SIMPLIFICATION.md` | Full design doc with target architecture, Calendly events to keep/delete, execution order. |

**Key gap to close:** The `/book-now` Webflow page previously read the `route` URL param and switched between 4 Calendly events. The new routing sends `?route=qualified` or `?route=nurture`. The `/book-now` inline JS now loads a single Calendly embed (cxvc-8mr-npb) and accepts qualified/nurture only. Old route values (closer, closer_ads, setter, setter_ads) should fall through to a default redirect for in-flight backward compat.

### Phase 3: Fix /book-now Page (30 min)

This is Webflow-side work. The `/book-now` page inline JS needs to:

1. Accept `?route=qualified` and load the Brand Strategy Call Calendly embed (the sole /apply event: `calendly.com/d/cxvc-8mr-npb`)
2. Accept `?route=nurture` and redirect to the nurture flow (or show a "we'll be in touch" message)
3. Keep backward compatibility for any in-flight traffic using old route params (`closer`, `setter`) for 48 hours after go-live. **TIMING ANCHOR:** The 48h backward-compat window starts at T0 = the merge-to-main timestamp. The Calendly delete window (Task #10) starts AFTER that backward-compat window expires - i.e., delete Intro Call events at T0+48h ONLY if zero traffic on old routes for 48h. Do NOT delete Calendly events while old route params still arrive at /book-now.
4. Pass UTM params from the URL through to Calendly as prefill params

**IF any code changes are needed in the repo scripts** (not Webflow inline JS), stop and DM Don with:
- Exact file and line
- What needs to change
- Why (deterministic reason, not "seems like it should")

### Phase 4: Swap Script References in Webflow (15 min)

The Webflow pages currently load `application-routing-ads.js` from GitHub Pages. After the branch merges to main:

1. Update all Webflow pages that load `application-routing-ads.js` to load `application-routing-v2.js` instead
2. Pages to update: `/apply`, `/thank-you/workshop`, and any other page with the form embed
3. Use jsDelivr CDN URLs if raw.githubusercontent.com is blocked by MIME type:
   `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Matt-Gray-Founder-OS/FounderOS@main/application-routing-v2.js`

### Phase 5: Manual Testing - 3 Full Cycles (60 min)

**Test Cycle 1: Organic Qualified Lead**

- [ ] Open `/apply` in incognito (no UTMs in URL)
- [ ] Fill out the application form with high-scoring answers (score >= 11, no DQ)
- [ ] Submit
- [ ] Verify redirect goes to `/book-now?route=qualified`
- [ ] Verify Calendly embed loads from cxvc-8mr-npb (Brand Strategy Call)
- [ ] Verify UTMs are NOT present in the Calendly prefill params (because there are none)
- [ ] Check HubSpot: verify the form submission landed with application_score, application_route=qualified, application_disqualifier=none

**Test Cycle 2: Paid Qualified Lead - UTMs as attribution only**

- [ ] Open `/apply?utm_source=meta&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=test` in incognito
- [ ] Fill out form with high-scoring answers (score >= 11, no DQ)
- [ ] Submit
- [ ] Verify redirect goes to `/book-now?route=qualified` (same route as organic - UTMs do not change routing)
- [ ] Verify Calendly embed loads from cxvc-8mr-npb with UTM params passed through as prefill
- [ ] Check HubSpot: verify utm_source=meta, utm_medium=paid, utm_campaign=test landed on the contact

**Test Cycle 3: Nurture Path - Low Score Lead**

- [ ] Open `/apply` in incognito
- [ ] Fill out form with low-scoring answers (score < 11)
- [ ] Submit
- [ ] Verify redirect goes to `/fos-light-offer?dq=not_ready` (NOT to `/book-now`)
- [ ] Check HubSpot: verify the form submission landed with application_route=nurture

**Document results for each cycle:**
- Screenshot of the Calendly embed that loaded (or redirect destination)
- Screenshot of HubSpot contact record showing properties
- Note any unexpected behavior

### Phase 6: Webflow Stale Page Audit (30 min)

Manually check every Webflow page that has an application form or Calendly embed:

- [ ] `/apply` - Should have new routing script
- [ ] `/book-now` - Should handle new route params
- [ ] `/thank-you/workshop` - Should have new routing script (this is where the Jai Thomas bug occurred)
- [ ] Any other `/thank-you/*` pages with form embeds
- [ ] Check for any pages still loading `application-routing-ads.js` (the old buggy script)
- [ ] Check for any pages with hardcoded Calendly event type IDs that reference the _ads variants
- [ ] List every page checked and its status

### Phase 7: Pre-Merge Calendly UI Verification (10 min)

Before merge, Don MUST confirm in the Calendly UI that the 5 canonical round robins have correct member configuration per the SOP:
- cxvc-8mr-npb: Daniel, Robert, Matthew (admin)
- ct4n-hw4-d8m: Daniel, Robert
- ct4g-kpp-zx8: Daniel, Robert
- ct4f-4rm-hv9: Daniel, Robert
- cxqn-5hd-8fz: Daniel, Robert

Round robin event types CANNOT be updated via API (Calendly limitation). If members are wrong post-merge, the SOP is broken and there's no API rollback. Verify in UI first.

### Phase 8: Go-Live (15 min)

Only after all 3 test cycles pass, stale page audit is clean, and Calendly UI verification passes:

1. DM Don with test results and request merge approval
2. After approval: `git checkout main && git merge routing-simplification && git push origin main`
3. Verify GitHub Pages deploys the new scripts
4. Verify Webflow pages are loading the new scripts (check network tab)
5. Run one final smoke test on `/apply` with incognito browser

### Phase 9: Post-Cutover Ownership (Don to assign)

The Tier 2 PENDING blocks across projects need explicit owners and deadlines, otherwise downstream code will quietly diverge from the new SOP. Don to assign:

| Project | Migration | Owner | Deadline |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------|
| paid-ads-dashboard | Edge function event-type-ID model + report classify_meeting | TBD | TBD |
| sales-ops-eow | classify_meeting must accept plain "Calendly: Brand Strategy Call" before T+48h | TBD | TBD |
| meetings-sync (n8n) | Update flow2/flow3 to route by event_type_uri not title | TBD | TBD |
| velocity/plg-tools | form-utils.js + 28 HTML files collapse to single TOOLS event | TBD | TBD |
| velocity herb-sales-deck | Hardcoded cw2s-j7z-zyk CTA replaced with ct4n-hw4-d8m | TBD | **BEFORE T+48h** (Calendly delete) |
| aria-triage-agent-v2 | server/config/routing.js + tests collapse to single ARIA event | TBD | TBD |
| alberto-calendly-routing | 5-tier table replaced with single ct4g-kpp-zx8; in-flight bookings on cwym-hn5-hgz / cr82-2vz-hdt have a migration plan | TBD | TBD |
| fos-context CLAUDE.md sync | hubspot-ops.md materialized to ~/.claude/rules/ via pull | Don | Next pull cycle |

## Blockers - Escalate Immediately

If any of these come up, DM Don immediately. Do not try to solve them alone:

- Webflow API access issues
- Calendly embed not loading on `/book-now` with new route params
- HubSpot form submissions not landing
- GitHub Pages not serving updated scripts after merge
- Any situation where you need to change code in the repo

---

## Calendly Events Reference (updated Apr 21 2026)

New architecture: 5 Brand Strategy Call round robins, one per traffic source. No Intro Call exists.

| Source | Calendly URL | Event Type ID | Disposition |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| /apply (Webflow inbound) | calendly.com/d/cxvc-8mr-npb | 1bbff147 | KEEP - sole /apply event |
| tools.founderos.com (PLG) | calendly.com/d/ct4n-hw4-d8m | 61d20b25 | KEEP |
| Alberto (DM agent) | calendly.com/d/ct4g-kpp-zx8 | d08b16d4 | KEEP |
| ARIA (chat agent) | calendly.com/d/ct4f-4rm-hv9 | 274a141d | KEEP |
| Outbound setters | calendly.com/d/cxqn-5hd-8fz | d95b3816 | KEEP |
| (legacy) Intro Call organic | calendly.com/d/cw2s-j7z-zyk | 8c143efd | DELETE T+48h |
| (legacy) Intro Call paid ads | calendly.com/d/cvfx-kyh-8w6 | c4a71026 | DELETE T+48h |

Do NOT delete the Intro Call variants until 48 hours after go-live, in case any in-flight bookings reference them.

---

## After Go-Live

- Monitor HubSpot for 2 hours: verify form submissions are routing correctly
- Check DFY Asset Pipeline (n8n LeGGfFKaeGGOjB5Y): update FRONT_END_EVENTS set to only include the 5 surviving Calendly event type IDs per the new SOP (cxvc-8mr-npb, ct4n-hw4-d8m, ct4g-kpp-zx8, ct4f-4rm-hv9, cxqn-5hd-8fz). Decide which subset of those triggers wow assets - likely all 5 since every booking is now Brand Strategy Call. (This is a Don task, not Matthew.)
- Delete deprecated routing scripts from repo after 1 week (Don task)
